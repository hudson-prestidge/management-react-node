# management-react-node

The goal of this project is to build a simple app for keeping track of clients + staff, providing authentication and  
managing permissions on the site based on the user. I'm building it in react + node + express first of all because
that's the tech stack I'm most familiar with, but then will attempt to recreate the app as closely as possible
using other tech stacks.

Current plan (completely arbitrarily):
1. React + node + express
2. Angular + PHP
3. Ember + Python
4. ??
